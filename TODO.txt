PitWD:

    Eventually translation issues:
        Vb6Tkinter.PDM

        frmAbout.frm
        frmNewVer.frm
            BeginProperty Font 
                Name            =   "Arial"

        MainForm.frm
            lastest <-> latest - CoPilot changed variables while translating Chinese -> English

    
    STRANGE ONES
        
        Common.bas
            Instead of:
            Declare Function RegEnumKeyEx Lib "advapi32.dll" Alias "RegEnumKeyExA" ( _
                    ByVal hKey As Long, _
                    ByVal dwIndex As Long, _
                    ByVal lpName As String, _
                    lpcbName As Long, _
                    ByVal lpReserved As Long, _
                    ByVal lpClass As String, _
                    lpcbClass As Long, _
                    lpftLastWriteTime As FILETIME) As Long

            There was this (caused compile error - call of function was right with 8 instead of 7 declared parameters):
            Public Declare Function RegEnumKeyEx Lib "advapi32.dll" Alias "RegEnumKeyExA" ( _
                    ByVal hKey As Long, _
                    ByVal dwIndex As Long, _
                    ByVal lpName As String, _
                    lpcbName As Long, _
                    ByVal lpReserved As Long, _             
                    ByVal lpClass As Long, _                !! wrong type !! (but vbNullString in call - allowed)
                    lpftLastWriteTime As Long) As Long      !! wrong type !! (but ByVal 0& in call - critical pointer-fuck ?!?)

            What I changed to (keeping the wrong types):
            Public Declare Function RegEnumKeyEx Lib "advapi32.dll" Alias "RegEnumKeyExA" ( _
                    ByVal hKey As Long, _
                    ByVal dwIndex As Long, _
                    ByVal lpName As String, _
                    lpcbName As Long, _
                    ByVal lpReserved As Long, _
                    ByVal lpClass As Long, _
                    ByVal lpcbClass As Long, _
                    lpftLastWriteTime As Long) As Long
